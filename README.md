# Course Description

TensorFlow is a powerful open-source software library for machine learning developed by researchers at Google. It has many pre-built functions to ease the task of building different neural networks. TensorFlow allows distribution of computation across different computers, as well as multiple CPUs and GPUs within a single machine. TensorFlow provides a Python API, as well as a less documented C++ API. For this course, we will be using Python. 

This course will cover the fundamentals and contemporary usage of the Tensorflow library for deep learning research. We aim to help students understand the graphical computational model of TensorFlow, explore the functions it has to offer, and learn how to build and structure models best suited for a deep learning project. Through the course, students will use TensorFlow to build models of different complexity, from simple linear/logistic regression to convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks to solve tasks such as word embedding, translation, optical character recognition, reinforcement learning. Students will also learn best practices to structure a model and manage research experiments.
